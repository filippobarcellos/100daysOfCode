# 100 Days Of Code

The challenge to code at least one hour every day for the next 100 days.

### Two Main Rules

### Motivation

> I've decided to take the 100 days of code challenge because I want to develop a coding study routine and improve my tech skills. I love computing and I believe the #100DaysOfCode challenge will help me to become a better programmer!
